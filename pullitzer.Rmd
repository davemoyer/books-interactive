## Context
Several years ago, I resolved to read more books, but was a bit lost as to how go about it.
I figured award-winning books were a good start, and no better system than the Pulitzer, which
has "History" and "General Non-Fiction" categories that I now try to read from. My goal is to have
read at least one of the finalists each year.


```{r pullitzer-by-year, echo=FALSE}

pullitzer_years <- pullitzer %>%
  group_by(year, category) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(read))

ggplot(pullitzer_years, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(weight = count, fill = category)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r over-time, echo=FALSE}
plot_table <- pullitzer %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(category), desc(award))
head(plot_table)

```
