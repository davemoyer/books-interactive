```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
booklist <- read.csv("booklist.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(cowplot)
```

I found I enjoyed the simple process of writing down the books I'd read, which spawned this small effort. I soon set myself a target of reading 24 books annually, and also set a target of reading at least one Pullitzer Prize winning work each year.



### How I'm doing

Three years of steady progress with a peak in 2019. Then a decline...but so is life.

```{r over-time, echo=FALSE}
by_year <- booklist %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25) +
  ylim(0,30) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 24, 
             linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()

```

### What have I read this year?
```{r current-books, echo=FALSE}
library(reactable)

this_year <- max(booklist$year)

current_year <- booklist %>%
  filter(year == this_year) %>%
  select(-year,
         Title = short.title,
         Author = author)

reactable(current_year)

```
