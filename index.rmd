I found I enjoyed the simple process of writing down the books I'd read, which spawned this small effort. I soon set myself a target of reading 24 books annually, and also set a target of reading at least one Pullitzer Prize winning work each year.

```{r over-time, echo=FALSE}
by_year <- booklist %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.25) +
  ylim(0,30) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 24, 
             linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
table(booklist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
