```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

library(stringr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
booklist <- read.csv("booklist.csv") %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with('title'),str_squish))

```

I've also been tracking a little bit about who writes the books I'm reading. Ideally, the books I read will not only entertain me, but expand my worldview. There are lots of ways to think and measure that, but a simple one is to track the
backgrounds of the authors, so I'm starting there.


```{r author-background, message = F, out.width='100%'}

library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)

authors <- booklist %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            pct_of_color = round(100*mean(author.of.color, na.rm = T),1),
            pct_female = round(100*mean(author.female, na.rm = T),1)) 


author_fig <- plot_ly(authors, x = ~year, y = ~pct_of_color, name = 'Authors of Color', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~pct_female, name = 'Female Authors', type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = 'h'),
         yaxis = list (title = 'Percentage'),
         xaxis = list (title = ''))
config(author_fig, displayModeBar = F)
  
```
